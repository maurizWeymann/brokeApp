# Milestone 1

## Project name: 'Broke'

### A small app that can calculate the time period it will take you to get you rich

## HowTo

Simply enter the monthly amount you plan to invest, the approximate increase rate and a time period to generate the overall outcome.
Optional start with the outcome you would like to receive after a certain period of time, enter the expected increase rate and the app will tell you how much you will have to invest to reach that goal.

## TechInsights

This app will be storing user input from forms into a database, do calculations with this data and provide a view on the user screen with the results.
The user can change the input data at any time, this will override the values in the database and refresh the view
